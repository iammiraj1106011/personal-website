            <h3>Web Developer</h3>
            <p>I’m a web developer. I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript;
                dabbling with Node.js and MangoDB; and inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless information
                through a
                few
                hundred RSS feeds. I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well.</p>

            <h2>Without Limits</h2>
            <p>I’m curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different
                direction. I do my best to stay on top of changes in the state of the art so that I can meet challenges
                with tools well suited to the job at hand. The list of projects I follow on GitHub will give you a good
                idea of the types of tools I’d prefer to be using, and my Instapaper “Starred” list will give you a
                glimpse into the reading material I find interesting enough to share.</p>

            <h2>Global Community</h2>
            <p>A developer community generally defined is a group of developers gathered in a place to achieve a common
                goal.What is a community?

                Communities are all centered around contributing and interacting with the express purpose of
                establishing a foundation of organic knowledge sharing, ultimately becoming an on-demand knowledge base
                for faster workflows and decreased support costs. The best developer communities encourage the creation
                and curation of on-demand knowledge bases through gamification including badges, profile status
                achievements, and leaderboards.</p>
